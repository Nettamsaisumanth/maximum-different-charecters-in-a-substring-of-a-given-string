# maximum-different-charecters-in-a-substring-of-a-given-string
In this we find the length of maximum number of different charecters in a substring of given string
Here first the code we wrote is a function to find the maximum number of diffrent characters
algorithm for this is
1. initialize all the ascii character count(256 charecters ) to 0
2. then for each charecter increment count by 1
